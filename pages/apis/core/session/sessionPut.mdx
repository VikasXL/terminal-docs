## Description

Each browser tab creates a unique session which is kept alive through periodic pings. When the session gets
created the user is "online" and ready to receive publications on the topic she has subscribed. When the
session closes the user's "last online timestamp" is updated. The session can close because of user logout,
missed pings, tab refresh, tab close or delete account through some other device.

## Signal format
